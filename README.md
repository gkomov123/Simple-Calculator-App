# Simple Calculator App
Simple Calculator App written purely in python without using the eval() function, using tkinter for the GUI.

## Features
* addition
* subtraction
* multiplication
* division

The app can do simple calculations, the % percent operator gives you the decimal precentage representation of a number: 40 -> 0.4 ect.

The "√" button give you the square root of a given number: 9 -> 3, it uses the python pow() function.

## TODO features

I plan to add more scientific operation like sin, cos, tg, log and whatever i think of.
