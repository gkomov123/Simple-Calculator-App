Simple Calculator App written purely in python without using the eval() function, using tkinter for the UI.

## Features

The app can do simple calculations, the % percent operator gives you the decimal precentage representation of a number: 40 -> 0.4 ect.

## TODO features

I plan to add square root ("âˆš") operation in the future for now i have implemented the button.

I also plan to add more scientific operation like sin, cos, tg, log and whatever i think of.
